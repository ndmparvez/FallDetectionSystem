#Description:
  Falling down is too risky to many old men. If they fall, we must help them as soon as possible before
any accidents happen. The problem is we can't always keep watch on their activities. The considerable
risk of falls and the substantial increase in the elderly population make the automatic fall detection
system become very important. Existing fall detection systems using accelerometer as the detector are
often designed based on an empirical acceleration threshold to differentiate falls from normal
activities. An optimal detection threshold can be obtained which meets the specified false alarm rate
while maximizing the detection probability. So, in this project we will create a prototype of fall
detection to solve the problem above. This device should send an alert to your mobile phone if fall is
detected.
